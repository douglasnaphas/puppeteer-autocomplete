# puppeteer-autocomplete

Try to use autocomplete on fields with Puppeteer.

I was not successful. I can get the autocomplete menu to show up, but I cannot
get Chromium to select from it, even by clicking in the text box and pressing
the down key (which works when using the browser manually).

# Run

Clone the repo and `cd` into its directory, then:

```
npm install
node app.js
```

```
# New terminal
node puppeteer-autocomplete.js
```
